# MachineLearningCoursework

# Assignment 1 (Build CNN)
The goal of this project was to train a Neural Network Model to predict whether a client would respond positive or negative to the banking campaign with at 
least 80% accuracy. The desired target is whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit (yes or no). The data given is related with direct marketing campaigns
of a banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access 
if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.
Input variables in form of bank client data, information regarding the last contact of the current campaign, social/economic context attributes and other attributes.

# Assignment 2 (Sentiment Analysis Comparing 2 Different Classifiers)
The goal of this project was to build 2 different machine learning models for sentiment analysis deciding whether tweet text is positive or negative. 
The performance of the 2 classifiers are then compared. The data used in this experiment is Sentiment140 dataset, a publicly available data set created by 
three graduate students at Stanford University: Alec Go, Richa Bhayani, and Lei Huang.


# Assignment 3 (Human Activity Recognition using clustering)
The UCI human activity using smartphone sensor dataset is made up of 30 subjects performing activities of regular living (Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone. The phone was configured to record two implemented sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope). For these time series the directors of the original study performed feature generation and generated the dataset by moving a fixed-width window of 2.56s over the series. Since the windows had 50% overlap the resulting points are equally spaced (1.28s).
The goal of this project is to use DBSCAN to do clustering on the given human activity using smartphone sensor dataset. Two datasets are used one with a dimensionality reduction technique applied (PCA) and one where it was not. Then the clustering done via dimensional reduction and without are then compared in terms of computational efficiency and clustering output.
