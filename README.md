# MachineLearningCoursework

# Assignment 1
The goal of this project was to train a Neural Network Model to predict whether a client would respond positive or negative to the banking campaign with at 
least 80% accuracy. The desired target is whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit (yes or no). The data given is related with direct marketing campaigns
of a banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access 
if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.
Input variables in form of bank client data, information regarding the last contact of the current campaign, social/economic context attributes and other attributes.

# Assignment 2
The goal of this project was to build 2 different machine learning models for sentiment analysis deciding whether tweet text is positive or negative. 
The performance of the 2 classifiers are then compared. The data used in this experiment is Sentiment140 dataset, a publicly available data set created by 
three graduate students at Stanford University: Alec Go, Richa Bhayani, and Lei Huang.
